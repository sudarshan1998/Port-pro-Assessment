# Introduction

This is a assessment in which we get data from multiple databases according to the version mentioned in the route.
We solved the problem using the ```Dependency Injection Design Pattern```.

# Technologies

## Node.js

 We used Node.js environment.

 ## Sequelize

 We used sequelize ORM for data mapping.

 ## SQLite

 For the ```v1``` route, we used SQLite as a database.

 ## MongoDB

 For the ```v2``` route, we used MongoDB as a database.

 ## PostgreSQL

 For the ```v3``` route, we used PostgreSQL as a database.

# Installation

To install, go the root directory and enter the command ```npm install```.

Make sure that MongoDB and PostgreSQL are installed and configured properly.

# Run the project

After the packages has been installed, go to the root directory and enter the command ```node seed-data.js```. It will seed the data into the respective databases.

Now, go to the root directory and enter the command ```node index.js```. It will run our app in 5000 port.
